# Machine learning univeristy classes
## Here you can find some solved tasks from lecture called 'Big Data methods and tools', but in my opinion, instead of using word 'Big Data' it would be more appriopriate to call it 'Machine learning methods'. Instructions are written in polish, but if you would like to know exactly what they mean, please contact me, it will be a pleasure for me to explain it ;)
