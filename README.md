# Machine_learning_univeristy_classes
## Here you can find some solved tasks from lecture called 'Big Data methods and tools', but in my opinion, instead of using word 'Big Data' it would be more appriopriate to call it 'Machine learning methods'. Instructions are written in polish, but to quickly sum up, currently these tasks focus on linear regression, regularization and interpolation.
